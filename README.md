# Qverse

Qverse is a simple Q&A platform I built using **React, Vite, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
The project includes user authentication (Signup & Login) using **JWT**, and a connected backend that stores user data securely in MongoDB Atlas.

## About the Project

The goal of Qverse is to create a space where users can ask and answer questions, similar to a discussion platform.  
Right now, this version focuses only on the **authentication system** — a working login and signup flow connected to the backend.

Once logged in, users are redirected to the main home page where further features will be built (like posting questions, viewing answers, etc.).

## Features

- Signup and Login system with JWT authentication  
- MongoDB Atlas connection for cloud database storage  
- Protected routes for authenticated users  
- Token stored securely in `localStorage`  
- Frontend built with **React + Vite**  
- Backend built with **Node.js + Express + Mongoose**

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Vite, Axios  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
**Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT)

## Future Plans

- Add question posting and answering functionality  
- Like / vote system for answers  
- User profile pages  
- Dark theme and responsive UI improvements

💡 *This is an early version of Qverse focusing only on authentication, built to understand how frontend and backend communicate securely.*
